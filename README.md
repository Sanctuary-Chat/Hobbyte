## Preface

With many contemporary social media platforms using our data to curate advertisements and give access to third parties, the demand for private social media arise. Sanctuary Chat is a cross platform social media app featuring two-factor authentication and end-to-end encryption, thereby providing users with optimal security and privacy. 

This is a senior design project, specifically for the class ECS193 A/B at UC Davis. Justin Jia, a former student and mentor for the senior design class at UC Davis, was our client who gave us the opportunity to build this application.

## Overview of the Product
Sanctuary Chat offers Two-factor authentication (by default) as an additional security layer. After entering a user's credentials to login, Sanctuary Chat sends an SMS text containing a OTP (one time password) to the phone number associated with that profile. This ensures that a user can be logged-in from only one device.

Chat messages are deleted from Sanctuary Chat's database once the messages are sent to the respective recipients' devices. If a user loses chat history or conversations with a recipient, a backup of the conversation history can be provided by other recipients in the same chat room.

Additionally, conversations are encrypted in transit into ciphertext before they're stored in Dynamo DB. Personal conversations are end to end encrypted using the Diffie Hellman key exchange. Group conversations are encrypted symmetrically.

Sanctuary Chat is transparent with storing user's data and collects miniminal user information during SignUp. The personally identifiable information collected from users include email and phone number, both of which are crucial for password recovery and 2-factor authentication respectively.


**Software:**
- React Native - UI/UX
- Expo - CLI for building, testing
- AWS AppSync - Communication
- AWS DynamoDB - Message queue
- AWS Cognito - Two-Factor Authentication
- TweetNaCL.js - Encryption library

## Installation or Distribution





## App Functionality
### Sign Up, Login, and User Information Changes

Sign up requires the user to provide:

- Username 
- Password - must be longer than 8 characters
- Email 
- Phone Number
- Consent to Terms and Conditions

The goal of Sanctuary is to have minimal user information on record. This information is stored on AWS Cognito which has customizable multi-factor authentication steps. In Sanctuary, the following two-factor authentication policies were set up to maintain optimal security for the user:

- **Sign up** - After submitting the above account information, they must verify their account by entering a temporary pass code that they receive via text message to complete the signup process. 

(Note: If the user tries to login with an account that has not been verified by entering the one time pass code, they will be redirected to the page where they can complete the account verification process, instead of being logged in.)
- **Login** - User must enter username and password as well as a temporary code texted to their verified phone number.
- **Changing email** - A temporary code is sent to the user's new email to verify it. 
- **Changing phone number** - A temporary code is sent to the new phone to verify it.
- **Changing password** - A temporary code is sent to the verified phone number. 


### Local Storage

Sanctuarty uses [AsyncStorage](https://reactnative.dev/docs/asyncstorage) to store files on device.
Five pieces of information are stored as the following key-value pairs:
1. **"User"** - User token for signin
2. **"keys"** - the User's private key used for encryption
3. **"rooms"** - List of all rooms with basic info.
4. **roomId** - message history for each room based on the rooms' ids
5. **roomId+"settings"** - settings for each room based on the rooms' ids

### Room List and Room Creation

The room list screen provides navigation to each chat room, creation of new chat rooms, and navigation to user settings. Room summaries are stored under the "rooms" key in async storage and displayed as a flatlist. Each item contains the room id, room name, and an unread message count. 

Room creation requires a list of members (not including yourself) as a comma separated list and optionally a custom name for the chat room. The default room name will be "Chat!" if no other name is entered.

### Chat

Our chat interface utilizes [Gifted Chat](https://github.com/FaridSafi/react-native-gifted-chat) by FaridSafi. It's behavior and layout is similar to Apple's iMessage. It allows the user to enter a message in a discrete text box at the bottom of the screen and then send it. The sender's messages appear on the right and other member's messages appear on the left with a corresponding avatar and username.

User's can scroll up to see previous messsages. 

On the Rooms list screen, the user will see an unread number count next to the room which updates when an incoming message arrives in that room. 

Extra customization in Chat is handled in Room Settings.




###  Message Queue 

To maintain user privacy, the AWS Dynamo database as used as a message queue and channel. 

- **Message storage** - Messages are only temporarily stored on the database if the other user is offline. 
- **Message retrieval** - When recipient is online or comes online, messages are retrieved and stored on the user's local storage then deleted from the database. 
- **Outstanding messages** - Any messages that are not read or retrieved are only allowed to stay on the database for a week and then they are deleted. 
- **Encryption Key Storage** - Public encryption keys are stored indefinitely on the database and are updated everytime the user signs into their account.

Public keys are stored and maintained in this message queue so that they're accessible by any user who would like to start a conversation. 

AWS AppSync API was used to create this message queue communication. AppSync uses GraphQL schemas to route data from user's account to the AWS Dynamo database. In this project, GraphQL queries and mutations were used to create, delete, and query messages as well as public encryption keys from the database. User information, content, and settings are encapsulated in GraphQL requests which are JSON objects.

### Room Settings

The room settings page provides customizable room name and text or bubble colors. It also allows for the adding/removing of members and sending of the full message history (like a forced backup) to other users. Setting changes and backups are a different message type so that they are handled appropriately.


### Encryption

To ensure messages are protected from MITM (Man in the Middle) attacks, we utitlize [TweetNaCl](https://github.com/dchest/tweetnacl-js) for encrypting conversations.

#### Peronsal conversations (room of 2 participants)

Conversations between two are end to end encrypted with TweetNaCl's box method. With box, each of the two participants create a distant key pair, comprising of a *private* and *public* key.

The partipants share their *public* keys with each other (via AWS). Using the Diffie Hellman key exchange, the *public* keys (of the other participants) are combined with the local *private* key to sign and encrypt data.

- **Encryption** -The sender signs the outgoing message with their local *private* key and encrypts with the recipients *public* key. Additionally, every message is encrypted along with a nonce. The nonce jumbles the initial text with random characters before encrypting it to ciphertext. This is crucial since the encrypted ciphertext shouldn't be identical in length to the unencrypted text.

- **Decryption** -The recipient verifies the signature with the senderâ€™s *public* key and decrypts the message with their local *private* key. The nonce, which is sent alongside the encrypted message, is used to omit the randomly added characters during encryption and view the original message.

#### Group conversations (rooms of 2+ participants)
Group messages are encrypted symmetrically, using TweetNaCl's secretbox method, and are only visible to the participants of the group. 

Symmtetric encryption is when a single secret key is generated for every message along with a nonce which jumbles the message accordingly. The secret key and nonce is sent with the encrypted message to be used by recipients to decrypt.

## Troubleshooting

### > Sanctuary Chat
**Trouble Signing Up on Sanctuary Chat**

- Ensure the phone number is in the following format **+18885551234** exactly with the '+' and no spaces or characters between the numbers. 
- Email must be a valid format following these guidelines:
"mysite@ourearth.com
my.ownsite@ourearth.org
mysite@you.me.net "
(Source: https://www.w3resource.com/javascript/form/email-validation.php)

- Password must be 8 characters long in our code. We did not make it a requirement to have special characters, capital letters, or numbers. 

**Sanctuary App Crashing - Testflight build**
- Reinstall app to clear cache and try creating a new account again. 


### > Expo 

**Debugging on Expo**

If the app crashes, some ways to troubleshoot:
- Expo App crashes on start up 
    - The app's cache and local storage needs to be deleted. Uninstall Expo app and reinstall. If garbage data is retrieved from AWS, it can damage local storage for when one tries to open the app in the future. 
    - Check Console Log and Expo log for warnings and stack trace

If the app is not loading,
- Expo takes roughly 2-5 minutes to first build Javascript bundle and then load app on the first try depending on Wifi connection and device being used. We found that on UCDavis campus, the app took closer to 4-5 minutes to load on the first try and we found it easier to run the app on cellular or hot spot. Debugging over our home Wifi was much faster. 
- Use 'Tunnel' or 'LAN' to run app on phone.

**Expo App not receiving incoming messages**

- Stop Expo process running on computer and reload entire app. 
- A successful received message should display the following logs:
```
New Message: {
  "onCreateMessageByRecipient": {
    "id": "cc3dfe4b-030d-4771-b1db-b89db49d855e",
    "to": "abby",
    "from": "AWS",
    "payload": "{\"nonce\":\"bqVdVZg7cu/kXNl15OTdhIIo2+1Z7frq\",\"key\":\"\",\"payloadEncrypted\":\"ARA6ZA5fs2FrrfMIXnoDU3ZiRkL383DyNossvrlT1JOXcTCfrbp1TZAUD9rDyfZMCMbbhv5ZhrM8vUob3i/dC3wnFibTvWEmqXD6DqrvnYcV+ssFHMMGZbR5c+s0yzYFdCG3/evskZlXOOMWQo1ZY6EF4hUt+yuoMfXGeSCByxwgW7W8MbOdZkxd2C3XD9iHAIIcfTcaJ1bfgCC21EYkQCda7aEIs2lcBHYm1A2n22X7kEn73Ccwf3Jkvs6ONMx4sGxm7YcD5I+ofHBZAyvi/jRxothdpHxR+QEtPB4Pu1WnRyr57UedVmWiKz6crmNHZzibQA==\",\"box\":true}"   
  }
}
```
- Check sender's console logs to ensure message has been sent successfully. A successful message sent should display the following logs:
```
AWS Success - Create Message
Object {
  "data": Object {
    "createMessage": Object {
      "from": "abby",
      "id": "5fbce67e-6600-4557-bece-48a341de9344",
      "payload": "{\"nonce\":\"bqVdVZg7cu/kXNl15OTdhIIo2+1Z7frq\",\"key\":\"\",\"payloadEncrypted\":\"ARA6ZA5fs2FrrfMIXnoDU3ZiRkL383DyNossvrlT1JOXcTCfrbp1TZAUD9rDyfZMCMbbhv5ZhrM8vUob3i/dC3wnFibTvWEmqXD6DqrvnYcV+ssFHMMGZbR5c+s0yzYFdCG3/evskZlXOOMWQo1ZY6EF4hUt+yuoMfXGeSCByxwgW7W8MbOdZkxd2C3XD9iHAIIcfTcaJ1bfgCC21EYkQCda7aEIs2lcBHYm1A2n22X7kEn73Ccwf3Jkvs6ONMx4sGxm7YcD5I+ofHBZAyvi/jRxothdpHxR+QEtPB4Pu1WnRyr57UedVmWiKz6crmNHZzibQA==\",\"box\":true}",      "to": "viswaas",
    },
  },
}
```
This log is triggered when the subscription set up is notified of any additions to the database concerning the user.

**Expo App not sending messages**

If the app is not sending messags, check for 'AWS Success - Create Message' log. If it is not displayed, 
- resend message
- delete room and create a new one
- Check if correct username was entered 
- Reload app
- Check Wifi connection
- Check for Expo logs and warnings
- Reinstall Expo

### > Amazon Web Services

**AWS Dynamo Warning:** - GraphQLError: Request failed with status code 401

When sending messages, if the following error appears: 
```
Possible Unhandled Promise Rejection (id: 5):
Object {
  "data": Object {},
  "errors": Array [
    [GraphQLError: Request failed with status code 401],
  ],
}
```
The API key needs to be updated. To do this, it navigate to the AWS AppSync Settings tab. Copy the "Primary auth mode - API KEY" listed and paste it in the 'aws-exports.js' file in the Sanctuary Chat project. 


The following [tutorial](https://aws-amplify.github.io/amplify-js/api/globals.html#graphqloperation) step 4 - GraphQL API Operations details the placement of API keys and how they are required for any mutation, query, or subscription requests to the AWS Dynamo database. When creating the API at the beginning, the APIkey's lifetime can be set so it doesn't expire every 7 days per default.




**Stopped Receiving SMS codes**
The AWS spending budget needs to be increased if the SMS text codes for authentication have stopped working. The following [tutorial](https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/sns-sms-spending-limit-increase/) outlines the process. 



**Testing locally using AWS Query Tab**
The AWS AppSync Queries tab can be used to send test messages to the app. It is recommended that the programmer first send a test message from app to database, then copy the payload into the query. Then swap the usernames in the 'to' and 'from' fields. 
An example of mutation:

```
// Used for creating text message, changing room settings, removing or adding members
mutation CreateMessage {
      createMessage(
        input:{
        to: "user1", 
          from: "AWS",
            payload:"INSERT PAYLOAD STRING HERE"
        }
      ) {
              	id
                to
    	        from
               payload 
      }
    }


// Used to check for public key for a certain user
query checkForPublicKey{
  listMessages(filter:{
    to:{eq:"key"}, 
    from:{eq:"user"},
  }){
    items {
      to 
      from  
      id 
      payload 
      
    }
  }
}


```


Payload format - also avalailable in ```/src/payload.js```: 
```
{
    actionType: int 
    roomId: int 
    roomName: String
    roomMembers: [String]
    sender: String
    created: Date
    joiningMember: String
    leavingMember: String
    textContent: String
    newRoomName: String
}
```

## Frequently Asked Questions

**What if I lost my phone?**

If you have the same phone number, the account can be recovered since on sign in, a verification code will be sent to the phone number on file. 

If the phone number is changed, you must be logged in (requiring verification from the original phone number) to change the phone number. 

Other member(s) in the chat room can send a back up copy of the room's chat history by going to the room's Settings page and pressing the "Send Back Up" button at the bototm of the screen. 

Logging into account does not recover all previous conversations otherwise and usernames of other members are not remembered.


**How do I create a group chat?**

To create a group chat, add the usernames separated by **commas** in the Recipients field of the Create Chat Room screen. 
ex. 
```
user1, user2, user3
```
You can also add or remove members from the group in settings

**How do I leave a chat room?**

We wanted to allow users to remove chat history without being removed from the room. To remove yourself from the room, delete yourself from the members list in that room's settings

**How do I delete rooms or room members?**

Swipe on the room or member you wish to remove and tap delete.


## Known Issues and Edge Cases

- **End-to-End Encryption (in group conversations)**
    - Since the Diffie Hellman key exchange algorithm works only between a pair of keys (private and public), the only feasible way to implement the algorithm for group conversations would be to create shared keys per sender and recipient in the group, store shared keys, and then encrypt the same message separately. We did not have time to implement this and were not sure if this was scalable. 
- **Decrypting using old key (in personal conversations)**
    - We discovered that there is an edge case in the following scenario where a user would not be able to decrypt messages sent while they were offline:
    - ex. Bob sends some messages to Alice while she is offline. He then signs out and then back in. Whenever a user signs in, their pubic key is updated. Therefore, when Alice opens the app to retrieve the offline messages, she also needs to retrieve Bob's public key to decrypt. However, the messages have been encrypted with the Bob's old public key and now cannot  be decrypted. 
    - A possible solution proposed by the team was to store the shared key and only update it after it has retrieved a message. However this does would not work if there are multiple offline messages.

## Glossary

 - **App** - The app is in reference to the Sanctuary app.
 - **User** - The user is a person who has created an account in our app and uses it to message others.
 - **App creator** - This includes all developers of Hobbyte Team and any other programmer who chooses to use and build the Sanctuary App.
 - **Two-factor Authentication** - Two factor authentication is a security measure which requires the user to enter a piece of information they know and provide input from something they have. For example, a password would be something they know and a phone verification code sent to them would be something they have.
 - **End-to-End Encryption** - This is a security measure which encrypts a message that is sent from one user to another and cannot be intercepted by a man in the middle (MITM).
 -  **TweetNaCl** - An open source library providing decoding, keypair generation, encryption and decryption functions for two different encryption techniques 'box' and 'secretbox'.
 -  **Diffieâ€“Hellman key exchange** - Conceived by Ralph Merkle, this is a method of securely exchanging cryptographic keys over a public channel.This key exchange method allows two parties that have no prior knowledge of each other to jointly establish a shared secret key over an insecure channel. Used by TweetNaCl's box to exchange public keys. 
 -  **Nonce** - a random or pseudo-random number generated for every message to obtain a hash ciphertext. Nonce ensure the encrypted ciphertext and initial unencrypted text don't remain equal in length.
 - **Amazon Web Service (aka: AWS)** - This is a backend service which provides several microservices such as multi-factor authentication, user pools, and serverless pipelines for a certain price depending on data transactions and usage. This is a third party API.
 - **AWS Cognito** - This service allows the app creator to create groups of users, known as user pools, which have access to certain features or databases. This service also allows app creators to customize the handling of multi-factor authentication, user authentication, password recovery, and sign in setup.
 - **AWS Amplify** - This is the development platform on Amazon Web Service that allows the app creator to set up the React Native App with an AWS database and services. This provides the framework and development tools necessary for cross platform development for backend.
 - **AWS AppSync** - This service handles GraphQL requests and communication between the app and AWS databases. 
 - **AWS Databases** - Amazon Web Service provides a number of databases to work with. When building the Sanctuary App, we chose to use DynamoDB tables for creating our message queue and room tables.
